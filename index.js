/**
 * Challenge:
 * 
 * Try to determine which of the 2 cards is the "winner" (has higher value)
 * Aces are the card with the highest "score"
 * 
 * In parts:
 * 
 * 1. Create a function that takes 2 card objects as parameters, 
 * `card1` and `card2`. These card objects have a property called
 * `value`, which can be any one of the following strings, in
 * order of rising "score":
 * 
 * "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "9", 
 * "10", "JACK", "QUEEN", "KING", "ACE"
 * 
 * I.e. "2" is the lowest score and "ACE" is the highest.
 * 
 * The function should determine which of the 2 cards (`card1`
 * or `card2`) has the higher score, or if they have the same score.
 * 
 * Log which card wins (or "It's a tie!" 
 * if they're the same) to the console
